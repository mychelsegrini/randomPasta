This simple project was built as an activty at the Technology and Leadership Institute (Inteli), located in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. It lies on a "game" within a webpage with a fish (a shark) that moves with the mouse pointer. In the background, alongside a sea wallpaper, there are some elements:

1) A generic island;
2) Part of the Bikini Bottom;
3) Ripjaws from Ben 10;
4) Gil from Bubble Guppies;
5) The Unicorn, a boat from The Adventures of Tintin;
6) Inteli's logo.
